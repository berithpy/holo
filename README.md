# holo_microservice
Tiny website to run on a raspberry pi (or equivalent) to write stuff on led matrixes!   
Called holo after the led inventor Nick Holonyak!   
This project relies heavily on the [Luma project](https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.led_matrix) to draw on the matrix!   

## TODO    
* cleanup matrix.py    
* improve website    
* documentation    
* Add "effects" methods to repeat phrases over time.   
* Add picture drawing!
